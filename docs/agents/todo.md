- User list is not updating
- interface super glitchy
- channel list is empty even if I joined something
- support ssl no verify
- nick doesnt get updated
- Channels dont get rejoined (auto join feature)
- make INTERNAL_API_SECRET optional in dev
- no live update on other joining/leaving a channel
- No live update on connecting and no indication of anything going bad if it gets stuck
- reconnecting to a server I see that I am still in a channel even though I am not. We need to fix the sync with the backend client
